# CheqIn

Your most reliable employee

## 🎯 What is CheqIn?
CheqIn is a GPS-based attendance system that automatically tracks when employees arrive at and leave the office. Simply set up your office location once, and CheqIn handles the rest; checking staff in when they arrive and out when they leave. Admins get real-time visibility into who's onsite, plus detailed attendance reports for payroll and HR.


**How it works:**
- Employee arrives at office → GPS detects their location
- Real-time dashboard updates → Admin sees who's present
- Employee leaves office → Automatic check-out after grace period
- Push notification sent → "Checked out at 5:47 PM - 8h 44m today"

## 💡 Why Does It Matter?

Businesses lose millions yearly in time theft due to:
- Falsified attendance records (aka buddy punching)
- Unrecorded absences
- Disorganized paper-based systems
- Time wasted on manual attendance tracking

CheqIn eliminates these problems with automated, accurate, tamper-proof attendance tracking.
